The data collection application was based on the CSPro (Census and Survey Processing System) software, Version 6.3, including a dedicated data management platform. Procedures and standards of the global MICS programme were adapted to the Nepal\u2019s MICS questionnaires.The CAPI application was tested in Kavre district during April 2019.

Similarly, the Ministry of Health and Population has also responsibility of producing data mostly on health and to some extent on population</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as vaccination, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition.\u00a0</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>A civil registration  system that continuously records all births and deaths in a population is the preferred source of high-quality underlying data on under-five mortality but these systems are not well developed in Nepal. Instead, household surveys and population censuses are the primary sources of underlying data in these countries. </p><p>The reliance on multiple data sources, i.e. surveys and census conducted several years apart but producing retrospective time series, can result in disparate mortality rates from different sources, sometimes referring to the same time period. Available data also suffer from sampling and nonsampling errors, including misreporting of age and sex, survivor selection bias, underreporting of child deaths, and recall errors as data are collected retrospectively. Further misclassifications can also impact on the accuracy of data, for example early neonatal deaths may be classified as stillbirths.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal de Taths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100 000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.</p><p>Data were received at the Central Bureau of Statistics\u2019 central office via Internet File Streaming System (IFSS) integrated into the management application on the supervisors\u2019 tablets. Whenever logistically possible, synchronisation was daily. The central office communicated application updates to field teams through this system. During data collection and following the completion of fieldwork, data were edited according to editing process described in detail in the Guidelines for Secondary Editing, a customised version of the standard MICS6 documentation.5 Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, Version 23. Model syntax and tabulation plan developed by UNICEF were customised and used for this purpose.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>There was a Technical Committee responsible for validating processed data at different stages. The experts at UNICEF headquarter also checked the processed data.</p>","IMPUTATION":"<p>Missing values are treated at the country-level. This is done as follows. There is no treatment of missing values at the regional level.</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p> The UN IGME applies a standard estimation method across all countries in the interest of comparability. This method aims to estimate a smooth trend curve of age-specific mortality rates, accounting for potential outliers and biases in data sources and averaging over the possibly many disparate data sources for a country. A more detailed descripition of the different phases of the statistical production process is available in the annual UN IGME report and at https://childmortality.org/methods.</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE":"<p> Quality is assured by applying standard statistical and demographic methods to all input data and conducting regular data quality assessments. Countries are also consulted on the draft estimates during the annual country consultation process. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"<p> The UN IGME aims to produce transparent, timely and accurate annual estimates of under-five mortality. Data quality is critical to that end. UN IGME assesses data quality using both internal and external validaity checks and does not include data sources with substantial non-sampling errors or omissions as underlying empirical data in its statistical model.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>Data are made available for Round 2014 and 2019.
