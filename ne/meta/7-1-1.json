The target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks. It represents the living standard status of people. It can be used in deriving multi-dimension poverty. </p><p>Under the national target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses specifically on electricity access available to population. In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary source of lighting is the electricity, solar systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Main aim is to estimate demand side access rates in order to better understand the access levels reported by the population. This is different from the supply side access rates usually provided by Nepal Electricity Authority. The data collected is compiled from NMICS as household survey. The population census also gives this kind of data by households. </p><p>The demand side and supply side proportion may differ in statistics.</p><p>The NMICS survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access. There are also some limitations that need to be addressed over time. In many parts of the country, the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate and consistent and reliability or affordable in cost. It would be desirable to have fuller information about these critical attributes of the service, which have been highlighted in SDG7. The indicator may be further be disaggregated.

A trend of data on access can be observed at district level.
