Two-stage stratified sampling was adopted where the number of households at ward level was obtained from the sampling frame of 2001 Population Census. In the <u>first stage</u>, 500 primary sampling units (PSUs) were selected with equal probability from 14 strata. In the <u>second stage</u>, 12 households were selected with equal probability in each PSU with an additional 6 households in each PSU, to be used as replacement household for non-response among the 12 originally selected households.</li><li>The survey enumerated 5988 sample households from 499 primary sampling units (PSUs) from the cross-section sample. NLSS-III used two types of questionnaires: household questionnaire and community questionnaire. There were 20 Sections in the household questionnaire which covered the topics of demography, housing, access to facilities, migration, consumer expenditure, education, health, marriage and maternity history, work and time use, employment and unemployment, wage and salary, agriculture, non-agricultural activities, credit and savings, absentee population, remittances and transfers, social assistances, adequacy of consumption and government services/facilities, and anthropometry.</li><li>Data were collected by 20 field teams consisting of one supervisor, three interviewers (including at least two female interviewers) and one specially trained data entry operator. The teams were based in the appropriate Branch Statistics Office (BSO) of the CBS, and each team covered on average 30 PSUs during a period of 12 months. The intensive training of the field workers (supervisors, interviewers, and data entry operators) was conducted for 25 working days before fielding the survey. The field-based data entry and consistency check technique was adopted.</li></ul>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Data collection was carried out over a period of 12 months to cover a complete cycle in agricultural activities and to capture seasonal variations in other variables.
